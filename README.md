## Including In Your Project
If you are a Maven user you can easily include the library by specifying it as
a dependency:

#### Maven
``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.infideap.atomic</groupId>
  <artifactId>atomic</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```
#### Gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
   compile 'com.infideap.atomic:atomic:1.1.2'
}
```

**or**,
you can include it by **download this project** and **import /atomic** as **module**.
